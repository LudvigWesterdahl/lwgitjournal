# SUS
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification

Single Unix Standard (SUS) is required for OS to use the UNIX trademark. It specifies C interface, shell and user commands.

Contains two primary parts: base spec (identical to POSIX) and the X/Open Curses spec.

Very few linux or bsd distros are certified, typically they go for POSIX compliance (without the official certification, known as being mostly compliant).
