# Lsb
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base

Project between linux distros to standardiseze the system structure like the file system hierarchy.

It was based on several open standards like POSIX, single unix standard and other.

On some systems a lsb_release -a command can be used to grt the version.


Since 2023 the project was declared abandoned by its mintainer.
